Predicting Indian Stock Market Index Movement using Macroeconomic Data and Machine Learning

This paper intends to explore the existing literature for the use of Machine Learning in Stock Markets, and propose an original Machine Learning based solution to predict Stock Market Index movement in India considering various macroeconomic factors, such as FII/DII Activity, US Global Market Index, Index of Industrial production, among others that could affect the Stock Market Index. We will explore, apply, and compare various Machine Learning Algorithms to construct models using various Macroeconomic variables to predict Stock Market Index Movement. With the prediction in place, traders can take positions on Stock Market Indexes to make a profitable trade.

Following Macroeconomic variables and Indexs are captured and analyzed for this paper are:

*   FII/DII Activity
*   GDP Growth rate
*   Crude Oil
*   Monetary Policy
*   USD/INR Exchange rates
*   US Global and Indian Market Index
*   Industrial Production
*   CPI
