This folder contains the notebooks for the three steps we performed in this report. 

- Step 1: In this step we downloaded, cleaned and consolidated the macroeconomic variables and index data for the next step.
- Step 2: In this notebook, we performed the feature and variables exploration and selection over the collected data.
- Step 3: In these notebooks, we explore the LSTM and CART models separately.
  - Capstone_project_Group_14_Step_3_Modelling_and_Evaluation_CART.ipynb: Explored CART to predict NSE Index using other macroeconomic variables.
  - Capstone_project_Group_14_Step_3_Modelling_and_Evaluation_LSTM.ipynb: Explored LSTM to predict NSE Index using other macroeconomic variables.
